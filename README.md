Project Title: African Wildlife Image Classification Using CNN
üìå Description:
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of African wildlife animals into different species. The model is trained and evaluated using a custom dataset structured into training, validation, and testing subsets. The dataset likely contains categorized images of wild animals such as elephants, lions, zebras, etc.

üîß Project Workflow:
Data Handling

Uploaded a ZIP file (african-wildlife.zip) containing the image dataset.

Extracted and organized data into training and testing directories.

Data Preprocessing

Utilized ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow for:

Rescaling pixel values.

Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shift, shear, flip).

Automatic generation of training, validation, and testing batches.

Model Architecture

Developed a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras with the following layers:

3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation.

MaxPooling after each convolution to downsample.

A Flatten layer followed by a Dense hidden layer.

Dropout for regularization.

Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Compilation and Training

Used Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

Accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Model trained on the training set and validated on the validation set.

Testing (assumed in later cells)

Likely evaluated model performance on the test set using accuracy or confusion matrix (not yet reviewed).
